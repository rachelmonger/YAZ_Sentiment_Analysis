## Problem Statement 

### Birth control medication is taken to treat issues ranging from acne prevention, anxiety/depression, pregnancy prevention and more. While birth control can be effective in certain ways, there are a lot of potential issues and negative side effects, which influence its user satisfaction.
### The goal of this project is to focus on the medication YAZ, a specific form of birth control, and analyze its user satisfaction. The end product is a text classification model to predict if reviews on YAZ as a birth control are positive, negative, or neutral.
